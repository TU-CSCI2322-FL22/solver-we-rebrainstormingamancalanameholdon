-- module Testing where

-- module stuff
--
-- for IO:
--
-- test against a lot of strings and game states
-- test against different filepaths???
--
--
-- for solver:
--
-- test who has won / who will win on many game states, both in progress and over gamestates
-- try states with multiple different potential best moves
-- try states with moves of potentially conflicting precedence (i.e., the first move you look at
-- might be a good one, but perhaps not as good as another move you have not looked at yet)
